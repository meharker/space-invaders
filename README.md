# space-invaders
a simple space invaders game using pygame . I dare you to make better version than mine

after downloading unzip the folder and run the main.py*

use space to shoot and the left and right arrow keys to move

*note i had some problems runing main.py with the python luncher and VS code but it did work in sublime text
